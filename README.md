# PinSentry-OTP
A Javacard applet to provide a OTP (One Time Password) implementation which can be used in conjunction with a Barclays PinSentry device.

## Introduction
With increasing attacks on networked devices, OTP provides a simple but effective additional layer of defense. However looking at existing implementations a number of problems are apparent:

* Small number of keys supported
* Cost
* Air gap

Many tokens providing OTP capabilities have only a very limited number of key slots which means either sharing keys between devices (bad), or having to buy and manage multiple tokens (also bad cost wise, and potentially confusing!). While prices for single devices can be quite reasonable, starting at about Â£20, if multiple devices are required that cost soon escalates. Another factor is that whether using an app on a smartphone, or hardware token connected to a computer, the key store is connected to a potentially compromised machine. While a hardware token should in theory be imprevious to a corrupted host's attacks, the integrity of any particular hardware implementation can only be verified by the manufacturer due to the closed nature of these devices. Smartphone apps provide a similar problem in that there is no way to reasonably audit key handling (and therefore potential for leakage), and the recent reporting of the Pegasus spyware reminds us of the vunerability of smartphones. So a method OTP generation that is air gapped (ie. not internet connected), providing a larger number of key slots (>128), and at low cost, would be useful.

## Implementation
Barclays Bank has distributed a large number of PinSentry devices to their (UK?) customers to facilitate internet banking. These devices are used in conjunction with an issued bank card to generate OTPs to authenticate login and transactions on their internet portal. Having a device to hand it seemed logical to use this as a base for building a generic OTP authentication system. These devices use fairly standard EMV (Europay/Mastercard/Visa) routines to acheive this[1]. So by combining one of these devices with a Javacard emulating a bank card would seem to provide a basis for this project. A Javacard applet emulating an EMV bank card was already available[2], so this was used as the starting point for the project. That project was however configured for a dutch bank and the PinSentry just rejected the card as it was configured. So having spent a couple of hours trying to reading data off an (expired!) Barclays card the code was updated to the point that the PinSentry device would interact correctly with it (recognise card/accept PIN/perform action/return result). Having proved the basic premise, the key store and OTP generation was written. Two basic problems arose at this stage, mainly due to the choice of Javacard.

## Requirements

## Compilation
Assuming you don't have Java 1.3 installed, compile with 1.3 format (I used Java 8):

javac -g -source 1.3 -target 1.3 -classpath <path to javacard kit>/java_card_kit-2_2_2/lib/api.jar psotp/EMV* psotp/PinSentryOTP.java
java -classpath <path to javacard kit>/java_card_kit-2_2_2/lib/converter.jar:<path to javacard kit>/java_card_kit-2_2_2/lib/offcardverifier.jar com.sun.javacard.converter.Converter -config PinSentry-OTP.opt
